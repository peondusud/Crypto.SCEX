The  information  in  this man page is an extract from the
full documentation of the GNU C compiler, and  is  limited
to the meaning of the options.
This  man  page  is not kept up to date except when volun­
teers want to maintain it.   If  you  find  a  discrepancy
between  the  man  page and the software, please check the
Info file, which is the authoritative documentation.
If we find that the things in this man page that  are  out
of date cause significant confusion or complaints, we will
stop distributing the man page.  The alternative, updating
the  man  page when we update the Info file, is impossible
because the rest of the work of maintaining GNU CC  leaves
us no time for that.  The GNU project regards man pages as
obsolete and should not let them take time away from other
things.
For  complete and current documentation, refer to the Info
file gcc or the manual.
The C and C++  compilers  are  integrated.   Both  process
input  files  through  one or more of four stages: prepro­
cessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.  Source file­
name suffixes identify the source language, but which name
you use for the compiler governs default assumptions:
gcc assumes preprocessed (.i) files are C and assumes C
style linking. g++ assumes preprocessed (.i) files are C++ 
and assumes C++ style linking. Suffixes of source file 
names indicate  the  language  and kind of processing to be 
done:
       .c C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .C C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .cc C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .cxx C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .m Objective-C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .i preprocessed C; compile, assemble
       .ii preprocessed C++; compile, assemble
